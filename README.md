##  Features

 --  Graphical User Interface (GUI): Visual representation of the maze and the solution path. ( SDL Library )<br>
 --  Pathfinding Algorithm: Automatically finds a path through the maze. ( DFS and Backtracking )<br>
 --  Random Maze Generation: A new maze is generated every time the program runs. ( DFS )<br>
 --  Cross-platform: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
